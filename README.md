# This is the server side of the website [Scotten Sound](https://www.scottensound.com).

This is also a show of skill as a programer as I have built this website from scratch using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The majority is written in [Markdown][1] with a little bit of HTML sprinkled in here and there to make some work easier with templates and more sophisticated pages.
