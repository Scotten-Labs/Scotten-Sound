        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>
            This is my final project from my Fall Quarter Sound Design 1 Class. This class focused on how people hear and interpret sound, both physically and emotional. We learned this quarter how to harness our abilities to evoke emotions with sound.

            In this peice I used multiple sound tools to create sound for the image provided. Those tools included are Themes, Repetition, Punctuation, Dynamics, Ambience, Aural Texture, Time, & Concrete v. Abstraction.
