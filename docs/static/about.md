# About Me

I have always enjoyed theatre and the performing arts; you could say it runs in the family. From a very young age I was around my grandmother’s, eventually mother’s, dance studio and grew up watching them teach and going to recitals. I never had a thing for dancing though, I instead found my joy in music and began learning a string instrument. I started with the cello and moved to string bass soon after. Throughout this time, I grew interested in the backstage crew and in how these events and performances were truly ran. I joined the tech theatre class in middle school but was sadly unable to fit it in my schedule again until my junior and senior year of high school. Nearing the end of my senior year, the technical director, Nolan Brokamp, mentioned that the Indianapolis Shakespeare Co. was looking for an intern in their sound department for their summer production of Hamlet. I happily applied and was accepted; my first real theatre job outside of high school and I loved it. Once that summer ended, I set off to Chicago to major in Sound Design at The Theatre School at DePaul with a minor in Network Engineering and Security.

Since then I have worked on many shows at DePaul and gotten a part-time job at DePaul University School of Music in the HPC Tech Crew. I have gained much knowledge and skills with teamwork working and running productions there.
