# About Me

I have always enjoyed theatre and the performing arts. Actually, it runs in my family. My grandmother and mother opened a dance studio the year before I was born. I literally grew up at the studio and regularly attended performances and dance recitals.

Greg Richards, the Theatre Director at Noblesville High School, where my family held their annual recitals, would invite me to assist backstage. He introduced me to technical theatre and mentored me throughout the years.

In middle school, when I was old enough, I joined the tech theatre class at my school. Sadly, I was unable to fit it in my schedule again until my junior and senior years of high school. Near the end of my senior year, my high school technical director, Nolan Brokamp, mentioned the Indianapolis Shakespeare Co. was looking for an intern in their sound department for their summer production of Hamlet. I applied and was accepted. My first real theatre job outside of high school and I loved it. 

Once summer ended, I set off to Chicago to major in Sound Design at The Theatre School at DePaul University with a minor in Network Engineering and Security.

I have enjoyed working on many shows in many venues at DePaul. I also work part-time at the DePaul University School of Music as a HPC Tech Crew Member and Manager. I have gained valuable knowledge, skills, and experience, from my professors, and I enjoy working alongside other talented and like-minded students. 

If you're wondering.... I learned early on that dancing wasn't my thing. I instead found joy in music; specifically orchestra and playing string instruments. I started playing the cello in 1st Grade and moved to the string bass soon after and played all through high school.
